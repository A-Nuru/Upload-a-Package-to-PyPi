# Upload-a-Package-to-PyPi
This project involves building a Python package and uploading the package to PyPi using object-oriented programming
The package could calculate both Gaussian and Binomial distributions give a data

## Installation
The libraries needed to run the code are the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation
This project involves building a Python package and uploading the package to PyPi using object-oriented programming





## File Descriptions
Files include
eko_probability01 folder containing the Binomialdistribution.py, Gaussiandistribution.py , Generaldistribution.py,
a readme.md, license.txt, __init__.py, setup.cfg files and __pycache__ folder; setup.py ; dist; and eko_probability01.egg-info


Binomialdistribution.py: This contains the Gaussian class

Gaussiandistribution.py: This contains the Binomial class

Generaldistribution.py: This contains the Distribution class

README.md: This contains the instructions on how to use the package and the associated modules

__init__.py: This allows the Gaussian and Binomial classes to be imported using shortcuts

licence.txt: This contains the package license



## Results
A package named eko_probability01 was created and uploaded to pypi and can be accessed [here.](https://pypi.org/project/eko-probability01/)
